# Conor Hassan

I'm a PhD candidate at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) with a focus on Bayesian federated learning, deep generative modelling, and probabilistic machine learning. 

### Some code projects that I would like to develop: 

- Expanded *variational approximation* algorithms for probabilistic models in the JAX ecosystem.
- Develop tooling for enabling optimization of "hyperparameters" (e.g., weights of a neural net) alongside optimization of variational parameters within a probabilistic programming library (closely related to empirical Bayes)!
- Learn Rust.
