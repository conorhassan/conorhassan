# Conor Hassan

I'm a PhD candidate at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) with a focus on Bayesian federated learning, deep generative modelling, and probabilistic machine learning. I have extensive experience with Python libraries like PyTorch, JAX, Pyro, and NumPyro. Always keen to collaborate on innovative projects, especially those pushing the boundaries of computational statistics and machine learning.
